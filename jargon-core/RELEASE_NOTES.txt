==Bug Fixes==

*[#1606] inconsistent objstat semantics for mounted collections
**Added an overhead to this iRODS bug where an objStat for a file in a mounted collecton always returns an objStat even if the file exists.  This is filed under iRODS, but the force overwrite logic was changed in a bug overhead to always use force when putting to a mounted collection, and we'll wait for an iRODS fix.


==Features==

*[#605] add mso object support
**CollectionAndDataObjectListAndSearchAO now supports mounted collection types

*[#1182] add support for workflows
