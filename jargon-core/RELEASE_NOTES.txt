Note that the following bug and feature requests are logged in GForge with related commit information [[https://code.renci.org/gf/project/jargon/tracker/]]

==Bug Fixes==
 
 *[#1263] ACL retrieval query and the user lookup queries, the method queries the zone of the user and not the zone containing the collection
 **Added code to properly query the permissions as they exist on the current zone
 
 *[#1139] Spaces at the begin or end of a data object name will cause an exception
 **removed trim() statements in query building to handle intended spaces in file names.  Note that there may be a bug for collection names with
 embedded spaces, this is ignored in the JUNit tests for CollectionAOImpl, and that issue has been routed to iRODS for now.
 
 *[#1243] issues with griffen with jargon 3.2.1.4
 **Remove over-headed create/close/open sequence for IRODSOutputStream creation
 **Reduce calls for objStat, no longer get an objStat on a parent directory, no longer creates parent dir if missing

 *[#1211] Re: [iROD-Chat:9536] jargon mangling UTF-8 characters
 **completed wiring codebase into jargon.properties settings
	 
==Features==

*[#1264] [iROD-Chat:9666] Referencing Data Objects
**Added findById() methods to DataObjectAO and CollectionAO

*[#1172] Jargon enhancements supporting HIVE integration project
**Added new methods to CollectionAO for paging queries by AVU using offsets
**Added row counts and other stats to MetaDataAndDomainData lists for find metadata by metadata query methods
