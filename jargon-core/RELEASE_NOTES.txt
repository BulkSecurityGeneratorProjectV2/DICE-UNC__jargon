==Bug Fixes==

*[#1606] inconsistent objstat semantics for mounted collections
**Added an overhead to this iRODS bug where an objStat for a file in a mounted collecton always returns an objStat even if the file exists.  This is filed under iRODS, but the force overwrite logic was changed in a bug overhead to always use force when putting to a mounted collection, and we'll wait for an iRODS fix.

[#1635] ttl parameter in PAM missing
**Fix PAM login errors on iRODS 3.3 due to addition of timeToLive parameter

*[#1726] need to add back flushes for 3.2 compatability
**add a force.pam.flush jargon property for pre 3.3 servers

==Features==

*[#605] add mso object support
**CollectionAndDataObjectListAndSearchAO now supports mounted collection types

*[#1182] add support for workflows
**Added jargon-workflow library and initial support for workflow objects

*[#1458] rule editor for user rules in idrop-web
**Added jargon-ruleservice to support interactive editing and composition of rules in interfaces.  Additional fixes in rule processing and parsing based on new use cases and testing.


*[#1776] add rule queue processing views
**Added code to delete selected rule from queue and expanded testing
