WORK IN PROGRESS

Jargon-core implements the iRODS protocol, and allows development of iRODS-enabled Java applications.  This API is especially useful for developing
mid-tier applications and services, as well as desktop-clients (such as iDROP).  These libraries also provide a foundation for a new set of interfaces that will come with iRODS.

Note that this release supports iRODS built-in authorization.  Adding GSI and general GSS support (including Kerberos) will come in a follow-on release planned shortly.

Note that this API represents a fundamental shift, and is meant to make development of applications easier and faster.

Please go to [[https://code.renci.org/gf/project/jargon/]] for the latest news and info.

Jargon-core consists of the following libraries

* jargon-core - base libraries, implementation of the iRODS protocol
* jargon-data-utils - additional functionality for dealing with iRODS data, such as building trees, storing information in iRODS on behalf of applications, and doing diffs between local and iRODS
* jargon-security - code for use with Spring security
* jargon-user-tagging - code for using free tagging and other metadata metaphors on top of iRODS
* jargon-transfer - transfer manager for managing and synchronizing data with iRODS
* jargon-ticket - support for ticket processing
* jargon-httpstream - stream http content into iRODS via Jargon

Other libraries are planned, such as connection pooling, as well as administrative functions.

==Requirements==

*Jargon depends on Java 1.6+
*Jargon is built using Apache Maven2, see POM for dependencies
*Jargon supports iRODS 2.4 through iRODS 3.0, and is tested with the current (as of release time) development version of iRODS

==Libraries==


Jargon-core uses Maven for dependency management.  See the pom.xml file for references to various dependencies.

Note that the following bug and feature requests are logged in GForge with related commit information [[https://code.renci.org/gf/project/jargon/tracker/]]


==Bug Fixes==

 * [#864] 2.5 iRODS protocol errors
 
 ==Features==
 
 * [#865] factor helper classes into jargon core and remove
 ** this is a general project cleanup and simplification task.  THe testing libraries have been consolidated and placed
 into the jargon-core so that they me used by unit tests in jargon itself, as well as other projects.  This removes jargon-test as a project.
