*'''git tag''': xxx

==News==

Jargon-core implements the iRODS protocol, and allows development of iRODS-enabled Java applications.  This API is especially useful for developing
mid-tier applications and services, as well as desktop-clients (such as iDROP).  These libraries also provide a foundation for a new set of interfaces that will come with iRODS.

Note that this release supports iRODS built-in authorization.  Adding GSI and general GSS support (including Kerberos) will come in a follow-on release planned shortly.

Note that this API represents a fundamental shift, and is meant to make development of applications easier and faster.

Please go to [[https://code.renci.org/gf/project/jargon/]] for the latest news and info.

Jargon-core consists of the following libraries

* jargon-core - base libraries, implementation of the iRODS protocol
* jargon-data-utils - additional functionality for dealing with iRODS data, such as building trees, storing information in iRODS on behalf of applications, and doing diffs between local and iRODS
* jargon-security - code for use with Spring security
* jargon-user-tagging - code for using free tagging and other metadata metaphors on top of iRODS
* jargon-transfer - transfer manager for managing and synchronizing data with iRODS

Other libraries are planned, such as connection pooling, as well as administrative functions.

==Requirements==

-Jargon depends on Java 1.6+
-Jargon is built using Apache Maven2, see POM for dependencies
-Jargon supports iRODS 2.4 through iRODS 3.0, and is tested with the current (as of release time) development version of iRODS

==Libraries==


Jargon-core uses Maven for dependency management.  See the pom.xml file for references to various dependencies.

Note that the following bug and feature requests are logged in GForge with related commit information [[https://code.renci.org/gf/project/jargon/tracker/]]


==Bug Fixes==

 [#621] error reading file w/group permissions
 [#627] Catch an NPE that might arise when transferring a file via streams when no resource in the iRODS file and iRODS has no default.  This was happening on a close() of the stream.
 [#629] malloc/resource error in irods when doing findDomainByMetadataQuery - added test for field-reported issue with metadata queries
 [#630] execute msiDataObjGet via Jargon - enhanced support for resource setting and overwrite options for client side get and put operations via rules, especially for parallel transfers resulting from client-side actions
 [#639] 809000 errors on delete operations when trash file already exists

==Features==

[#542] Ticket system support
- added a ProtocolExtensionPoint to the org.irods.jargon.core.pub access objects to allow higher level packages to handle packing instructions
- added jargon-ticket subproject for ticket admin support, along with unit testing of ticket system
[#625] Akubra intitial development
- additional URI utility methods for use in Akubra
[#631] buffering missing in streaming from file - added a new jargon.io.local.input.stream.buffer.size jargon property, as well as programmatic support.  This adds missing buffering when IRODSCommands is streaming a local file to iRODS.  This should give a slight but noticable performance boost.
 [#245] add noParaOpr keyword for put/get - TransferOptions and jargon properties now support a no parallel transfer opti
 [#632] add support for anonymous useron for get/put operations
 - added instance metods to IRODSAccount for anonymous user 
 - added to test setup script to create anonymous in the target server
 [#635] add jargon module for http streaming, pull out of jargon core
 - new jargon-httpstream service module for streaming data from a url into iRODS (uses Apache HTTPClient libraries)
 [#638] optimization pass
 -general profiling
 -improvement of parallel transfer
