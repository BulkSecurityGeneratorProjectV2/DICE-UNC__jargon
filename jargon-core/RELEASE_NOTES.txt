<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
*[#1606] inconsistent objstat semantics for mounted collections
**Added an overhead to this iRODS bug where an objStat for a file in a mounted collecton always returns an objStat even if the file exists.  This is filed under iRODS, but the force overwrite logic was changed in a bug overhead to always use force when putting to a mounted collection, and we'll wait for an iRODS fix.
