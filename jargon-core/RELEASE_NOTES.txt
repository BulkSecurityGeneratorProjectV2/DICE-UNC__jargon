==News==

Jargon-core implements the iRODS protocol, and allows development of iRODS-enabled Java applications.  This API is especially useful for developing
mid-tier applications and services, as well as desktop-clients (such as iDROP).  These libraries also provide a foundation for a new set of interfaces that will come with iRODS.

=======
Please go to [[https://code.renci.org/gf/project/jargon/]] for the latest news and info.

Jargon-core consists of the following libraries

* jargon-core - base libraries, implementation of the iRODS protocol
* jargon-data-utils - additional functionality for dealing with iRODS data, such as building trees, storing information in iRODS on behalf of applications, and doing diffs between local and iRODS
* jargon-security - code for use with Spring security
* jargon-user-tagging - code for using free tagging and other metadata metaphors on top of iRODS
* jargon-transfer - transfer manager for managing and synchronizing data with iRODS
* jargon-ticket - support for ticket processing
* jargon-httpstream - stream http content into iRODS via Jargon


==Requirements==

*Jargon depends on Java 1.6+
*Jargon is built using Apache Maven2, see POM for dependencies
*Jargon supports iRODS 2.5 through iRODS 3.3

==Libraries==

Jargon-core uses Maven for dependency management.  See the pom.xml file for references to various dependencies.
