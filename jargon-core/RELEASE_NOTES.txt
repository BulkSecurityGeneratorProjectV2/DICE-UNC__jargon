Maintenance release of Jargon

Jargon-core implements the iRODS protocol, and allows development of iRODS-enabled Java applications.  This API is especially useful for developing
mid-tier applications and services, as well as desktop-clients (such as iDROP).  These libraries also provide a foundation for a new set of interfaces that will come with iRODS.

Please go to [[https://code.renci.org/gf/project/jargon/]] for the latest news and info.

Jargon-core consists of the following libraries

* jargon-core - base libraries, implementation of the iRODS protocol
* jargon-data-utils - additional functionality for dealing with iRODS data, such as building trees, storing information in iRODS on behalf of applications, and doing diffs between local and iRODS
* jargon-security - code for use with Spring security
* jargon-user-tagging - code for using free tagging and other metadata metaphors on top of iRODS
* jargon-transfer - transfer manager for managing and synchronizing data with iRODS
* jargon-ticket - support for ticket processing
* jargon-httpstream - stream http content into iRODS via Jargon


==Requirements==

*Jargon depends on Java 1.6+
*Jargon is built using Apache Maven2, see POM for dependencies
*Jargon supports iRODS 2.5 through iRODS 3.2

==Libraries==

Jargon-core uses Maven for dependency management.  See the pom.xml file for references to various dependencies.

Note that the following bug and feature requests are logged in GForge with related commit information [[https://code.renci.org/gf/project/jargon/tracker/]]

==Bug Fixes==

*[#1092] add reconnect option to iDrop
**Add irodsAccount info to IRODSCommands during reconnect
**Add new constructor and initializer for IRODSCommands that avoids calling the finalizer on a connection when the IRODSCommands was created in 'stand-alone' mode.  This fixes a bug where
the connection finalizer could be called and the connection closed at an inappropriate time when in connection restart mode
 
*[#1093] Broken pipe error did not propagate in parallel transfer
**Small clean-ups in transfer processing and error call-backs
 
*[#1109] specific query no data found results in exception
**Specific query was returning a DataNotFoundException when no results returned, fixed to return an empty result set
 
*[#1139] Spaces at the begin or end of a data object name will cause an exception
**added trim to DataObjectAO, FileFactory, CollectionAO, and CollectionAndDataObjectListAndSearchAO methods that take a path
 
==Features==

*[#1140] user listing methods not sorted
**Added sorts to user find* methods and switched to builder queries
