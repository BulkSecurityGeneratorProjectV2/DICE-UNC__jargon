*'''Project''': Jargon-core API
*'''Date''': 11/15/2012
*'''Release Version''': 3.2.1
*'''git tag''': 3.2.1

==News==

This release includes important new features, notably, an expansion of available authentication modes.  This release also includes important bug fixes.  Jargon 3.2.1 is a recommended release
for all versions of iRODS.

Jargon-core implements the iRODS protocol, and allows development of iRODS-enabled Java applications.  This API is especially useful for developing
mid-tier applications and services, as well as desktop-clients (such as iDROP).  These libraries also provide a foundation for a new set of interfaces that will come with iRODS.

Note that this release supports iRODS built-in authorization.  Adding GSI and general GSS support (including Kerberos) will come in a follow-on release planned shortly.

Note that this API represents a fundamental shift, and is meant to make development of applications easier and faster.

Jargon-core consists of the following libraries

* jargon-core - base libraries, implementation of the iRODS protocol
* jargon-data-utils - additional functionality for dealing with iRODS data, such as building trees, storing information in iRODS on behalf of applications, and doing diffs between local and iRODS
* jargon-security - code for use with Spring security
* jargon-user-tagging - code for using free tagging and other metadata metaphors on top of iRODS
* jargon-transfer - transfer manager for managing and synchronizing data with iRODS
* jargon-ticket - support for ticket processing
* jargon-httpstream - stream http content into iRODS via Jargon

Other libraries are planned, such as connection pooling, as well as administrative functions.

==Requirements==

*Jargon depends on Java 1.6+
*Jargon is built using Apache Maven2, see POM for dependencies

*Jargon supports iRODS 2.5 through iRODS 3.2

==Libraries==

Jargon-core uses Maven for dependency management.  See the pom.xml file for references to various dependencies.

==Bug Fixes==

*[#1044] Jargon allows the creating of folders that exceed the USER_PATH_EXCEEDS_MAX and cannot delete them
**Added a new PathTooLongException and methods to check path lengths in MiscIRODSUtils, used these checks in the various path methods, especially
the IRODSFile and DataObject and Collection access objects

*[#1042] Chinese char set displays invalid characters 
**added new ConnectionConstants.DUMP_GEN_QUERY_OUT for optional dumping of gen query out XML messages when in log.debug mode

*[#1041] [iROD-Chat:8903] Jargon-core: query builder / SQL operators
**Fix issue with case insensitive queries (this included an iRODS patch post 3.2)

*[#1059] Re: [iROD-Chat:9011] Jargon-Core ParallelGetTransferThreads accumulating rapidly
**Added cleanup of threads when running using executor, added a finally with a shutdown() call 

==Features==

 *[#132] GSS and Kerberos Support in Jargon-core
 **added GSI to authentication methods
 
 *[#870] jargon support for PAM

 ** Support for PAM authentication (per Chris Smith's updates to iRODS) as a pluggable auth module in Jargon
 ** [#992] don't let public irods account trigger auth other then standard
 
 *[#974] anonymous link support
 **added isUserHasPermission methods for collections and data objects that indicate that a user has at least read permission on a file or data object
 **added AnonymousAccessService in data utils to help manage permissions for the anonymous user
 
 *[#1011] add a dedicated doAuthentication method ot irodsAccessObjectFactory

* [#1046] Add total row count to gen query out
**When creating gen queries from the IRODSGenQueryBuilder, one may now specify that total row counts (reflecting the total results in the database) be requested from iRODS.  This row
count will be provided in the IRODSQueryResultSet object when using the general query executor service.

*[#1055] -321000 messages on upload need better message
**Added a NoResourceDefinedException for jargon io operations to handle occasions where no default storage resource is set, and no iRODS resource rule is defined.  This 
helps clients better handle -321000 exceptions.  iDrop uses this to indicate that the user should select a default storage resource.
