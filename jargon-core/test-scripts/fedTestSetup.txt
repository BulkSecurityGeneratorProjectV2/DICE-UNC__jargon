Federation unit/functional tests setup

This documents the setup of extended test facilities for testing cross-zone federation.   For this initial version,
the test rig is comprised of two zones, which we will call test1 and fedzone2.  These names can be adjusted through 
testing.properties configuration.

Each zone has a test1-resc and a test1-resc2 resource, and a test1 user, such that that user is registered in the corresponding
federated zone.  There are a set of scripts for running on each zone to do the confguration, fedtestsetup_fedzone1.sh, and 
fedtestsetup_fedzone2.sh.

These setup scripts should be run after running testsetup.sh on BOTH test1 and fedzone2

The setup is based on the documentation at https://www.irods.org/index.php/Federation_Administration

The user test1 is set up in each zone with a /zone/home/test1/fedread directory with recursive read permissions
The user test1 is set up in each zone with a /zone/home/test1/fedwrite directory with recursive write permissions

The testing.properties in jargon.core has additional properties for testing with a federated zone configuration.  These tests
are off by default, but can be turned on by setting test.option.federated.zone to true.

The following is from the jargon-core pom.xml file properties, these should refer to properties set in the particular settings.xml file on the test 
machine, and should point to the properties of the second federated zone.  The first federated zone will use the normal test.irods.user, etc, and
this should typically be the 'test1' zone.

test.option.federated.zone={$test.option.federated.zone}
test.federated.irods.admin=${jargon.test.irods.admin}
test.federated.irods.admin.password=${jargon.test.irods.admin.password}
test.federated.irods.user=${jargon.test.irods.user}
test.federated.irods.password=${jargon.test.irods.password}
test.federated.irods.resource=${jargon.test.irods.resource}
test.federated.irods.host=${jargon.test.irods.host}
test.federated.irods.port=${jargon.test.irods.port}
test.federated.irods.zone=${jargon.test.irods.zone}
