Data Model for persistant app

-top level directory
--rules
--policies
--config

Things are set up to allow multiple rule mappings, multiple policies, etc.  These directories can also move around.  They are discovered by links set up in AVU triples
to a convention.

============================================

top level collection for a Policy Driven Service is marked with AVU 

Attrib: POLICY_DRIVEN_SERVICE_MARKER_ATTRIBUTE = "PolicyDrivenService"
Value: Name of the service
Units: Description of service


rule/policy/config diretories are marked with AVU on their collection

Attrib: "PolicyDrivenService:RuleMappingDirectory/PolicyMappingDirectory/ConfigurationDirectory"
Value: Name of mapping - unique
Units: Description of mapping


The Policy Driven Service Maps the rule/policy/config by name to locate the various collections, storing these mappings in the top level Policy Driven Service Collection

Attrib:'PolicyDrivenService:ServiceToRuleMapping/ServiceToPolicyMapping/ServicetoConfiguration"
Value: Name of rule mapping
Units: description of mapping

===========================================

Rule Mappings - XML Doc with descriptive AVU (Attrib: PolicyDrivenService:RuleMappingDocument Value:mapping name[version] Units: comment?? rule name???

Rule mappings are XML documents that describe a rule as a policy element, and describe the parameters in a way that they can be displayed as a user interface.  Rules are
defined as applying to a certain stage in the archive life-cycle.  (rules can later have a version #)


Policy Mappings - XML Doc with descriptive AVU (Attrib: PolicyDrivenService:PolicyMappingDocument Value:mapping name[version] Units: comment?? 

Policy Mappings describe the various steps in the archive life-cycle, and the rules/parameters that have been selected from the available rule mappings.  Policy Mappings also
include information on metadaa that will be required when an object is put into iRODS such that a user interface can be generated.  (these can later have version #'s that point
to versioned rule mappings)

===========================================

Mapped Policies are bound to a 'series'.  A series is an iRODS Collection at the top level, and has AVU's set up to bind a policy mapping/version to a series underneath the collection

Series Marked with AVU's


--Mark this series as being bound to a policy
Attrib:  PolicyDrivenService:PolicyBinding
Value: Policy mappingDocument name[version]

--Mark an attribute that fills a rule parameter
Attrib: PolicyDrivenService:PolicyBinding:RuleMapping:ParameterMapping
Value: RuleName:ParameterName
Units: bound value [literal||dynamically computed]
